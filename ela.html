            <p>Imagine a room in which you have a red button in front of you. This button, if pressed, will slowly degrade society and slow down our advancements with every press of a button. It may seem like a no-brainer to not press this button but it may not be apparent to others. This happens in the world of <em>Frankenstein</em>, but instead of a red button, there are biases. These two seemingly things that seemingly don't correlate are in fact the same thing. Both are unnecessary and optional. Both are terrible for society as a whole. So next time a bias pops into your head, think about the red button.</p>

            <h3>Thesis:</h3>
            <p>In the classic novel Frankenstein by Mary Shelley, a major theme of implicit bias is explored through the harsh judgment that is shown towards the monster by humanity.</p>

            <br>
            <p>I chose this thesis as it is relevant all throughout the novel. This idea of pretty privileges is a main point that reoccurs as the novel goes on. Additionally, these biases shaped the creature and Victorâ€™s destiny. If the prejudices were less harsh or nonexistent the story would have been completely different.</p>
