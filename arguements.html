            <p>The monster is exiled from society due to the prejudices against its appearance. Humanity is to blame for this unjust treatment as they only look upon the creature's appearance and judge him solely off of that. This is highlighted when the creature tries to enter a town for food. This reveals the society only cares about themselves and will even impair outcasts just because of their unwillingness to look past their ingrained prejudices.</p>

            <p>Despite Victor undoubtedly being a monster by abandoning his creation, he is not shunned nor pelted by rocks like the creature is. This is especially apparent when Victor is on Robert Walton’s boat and he is seen as a brother over a man who has put himself before others. Humanity has shown how far they are willing to exclude the monster, yet the creator is well respected amongst people. Society is known to accept a highly regarded man who has ill intentions, over an outcast who has done nothing wrong.</p>

            <p>Even though Safie was responsible for the cottagers' misery, she was still accepted over the monster because she looks more like them. This is shown in the cottagers' backstory about their poverty and even when they greet her how she doesn’t even speak their language. This contrasts to the creature as he only aided the cottagers and spoke their language. The only difference between them was their looks yet, the creature was beaten with a stick. This shows the fundamental problems in society as appearance is valued over everything, even over actions.</p>
